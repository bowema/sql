# Advertiser spend

Given the following two tables:

- Advertiser info table with columns `advertiser_id`, `ad_id` and `spend', where `spend` is what the advertiser paid for this ad.
- Ad info table with columns `ad_id`, `user_id` and `price`, where `price` is how much the `user_id` spend through this ad., assuming all prices > 0. 

Questions:
- The fraction of advertisers has at least one conversion.
- What metrics would you show to advertisers.
