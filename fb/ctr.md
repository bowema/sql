# CTR 
When a user is playing with an app, the app might pop up a window for user to add credit card information (event 'imp'). If the user clicks 'yes', then a click event is created.  
You have a table with { time | user_id | app_id | event }. `event` is either 'click' or 'impression'. 

1) How would you access the quality of app? (Calculate the click through rate).  
2) How would you find which app has highest ctr?  
3) How would you check if the table contains correct information? (ex, if a user clicked 'yes' once, the table may generate multiple click events)
